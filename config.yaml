# Reachy Wake Word Detection Configuration

# Detection threshold (0.0 - 1.0)
# Lower = more sensitive (more detections, more false positives)
# Higher = less sensitive (fewer false positives, might miss some)
threshold: 0.5

# Cooldown between detections (seconds)
# Prevents multiple triggers for single utterance
cooldown: 2.0

# Audio device
# Set to specific device number, or null for auto-detection
# Run with --list-devices to see available devices
device_index: null

# Chunk size (samples)
# Smaller = lower latency, higher CPU
# Larger = higher latency, lower CPU
chunk_size: 1280  # 80ms at 16kHz
